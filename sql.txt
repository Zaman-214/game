Great — here is a **complete SQL database schema** that includes:

✔ Players
✔ Game rounds
✔ Moves
✔ Scoreboard
✔ Relations between all tables
✔ Auto-increment primary keys
✔ Timestamps

I’ll provide **pure SQL commands**, ready to copy and run (works on MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL with minor adjustments).

# ✅ Full SQL Schema for Your Tic-Tac-Toe Game

---

## 1️⃣ **Players Table**

Stores user profiles (optional but useful if players have names).

```sql
CREATE TABLE players (
    player_id      INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    player_name    VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    avatar_url     VARCHAR(255),
    created_at     TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

---

## 2️⃣ **Game Rounds Table**

Each completed Tic-Tac-Toe game round.

```sql
CREATE TABLE game_rounds (
    round_id       INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    player_x_id    INT NOT NULL,
    player_o_id    INT NOT NULL,
    winner         VARCHAR(1) NULL,     -- 'X', 'O', or NULL for draw
    started_at     TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    ended_at       TIMESTAMP NULL,

    FOREIGN KEY (player_x_id) REFERENCES players(player_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (player_o_id) REFERENCES players(player_id)
);
```

---

## 3️⃣ **Moves Table**

Stores every move in every game (optional but powerful for replays / analytics).

```sql
CREATE TABLE moves (
    move_id        INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    round_id       INT NOT NULL,
    move_number    INT NOT NULL,
    cell_index     INT NOT NULL,   -- 0 to 8
    symbol         VARCHAR(1) NOT NULL, -- 'X' or 'O'
    played_at      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,

    FOREIGN KEY (round_id) REFERENCES game_rounds(round_id)
);
```

---

## 4️⃣ **Scoreboard Table**

Stores cumulative win/loss/draw totals per player.

```sql
CREATE TABLE scoreboard (
    player_id      INT PRIMARY KEY,
    wins           INT DEFAULT 0,
    losses         INT DEFAULT 0,
    draws          INT DEFAULT 0,

    FOREIGN KEY (player_id) REFERENCES players(player_id)
);
```

---

## 5️⃣ **Insert Default Two Players (X and O)**

If you want static players:

```sql
INSERT INTO players (player_name) VALUES ('Player X'), ('Player O');
```

---

## 6️⃣ **Example: Insert a New Round**

```sql
INSERT INTO game_rounds (player_x_id, player_o_id)
VALUES (1, 2);
```

---

## 7️⃣ **Record a Move**

```sql
INSERT INTO moves (round_id, move_number, cell_index, symbol)
VALUES (1, 1, 0, 'X');
```

---

## 8️⃣ **Set Game Winner**

```sql
UPDATE game_rounds
SET winner = 'X', ended_at = NOW()
WHERE round_id = 1;
```

---

## 9️⃣ **Update Scoreboard After a Round**

If X wins:

```sql
UPDATE scoreboard SET wins = wins + 1 WHERE player_id = 1;
UPDATE scoreboard SET losses = losses + 1 WHERE player_id = 2;
```

If it’s a draw:

```sql
UPDATE scoreboard SET draws = draws + 1 WHERE player_id IN (1, 2);
